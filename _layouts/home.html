        Ciao.
        <br><br>
        I am the co-founder of a company that leverages autonomous technologies to collect critical subsea data, primarily—but not exclusively—for offshore renewables developers.
        <br><br>
        Previously, I worked with family capital, asset owners, and corporate investors in deep tech. 
        <br><br>
        In the first half of my career, I spent 15 years or so focused on the problem of expanding access to capital in market segments and geographies that most investors overlook. This often entailed working with private equity and venture capital funds, institutional investors, and the founders of early-stage startups and mid-sized businesses.
        <br><br>
        In recent years, I've grown increasingly interested in blockchain's potential to transform the creation and exchange of value globally. That promise has largely remained illusory, and the industry is teeming with scumbags.

        I hosted a <a href="https://www.porticopodcast.com">podcast</a> on private markets that featured some great interviews, but I have deprecated it for now.
