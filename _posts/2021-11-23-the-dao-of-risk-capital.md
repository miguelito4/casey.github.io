<p>Thousands of strangers recently came together to bid on an original copy of the U.S. Constitution at Sotheby’s.</p>

<p>Once you see the power of a networked community first-hand, you can’t unsee it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">It’s like&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_329.html" target="_blank">The Blue Marble</a></em>&nbsp;photo from Apollo 17 — it changes your perception of the world.</p>

<p>* * *</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t mean to be hyperbolic, but web3 has the potential to change everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;going to change capital formation and entrepreneurial finance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DAOs can help close the financing gap for businesses all around the world. While it may be a stretch to say that DAOs will disrupt the VC / PE fund model altogether, consider the following</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Fundraising</strong>&nbsp;— Preqin data show that fund managers are taking 11 months to reach a final close in Asia, 25 months in LatAm, and 50 months (!) in Africa (YTD 2021).<br><br>This is just a horrifically inefficient market, with untold sums of wasted time and expenses, and countless volumes of CO2&nbsp;emissions belched in the atmosphere as people crisscross continents collecting capital commitments.<br><br>ConstitutionDAO raised over $40M in four days, seamlessly aggregating commitments from ~17,500 wallets. The median contribution was .0525 ETH (~ $225), with the top-quartile breakpoint at .1776&nbsp;&nbsp;ETH (~ $750).<br><br>Rather than approaching hidebound institutions and gatekeepers, a DAO can directly target true fans / believers — regardless of their ticket size. And the magic is that rather than a handful of people marketing a fund, the community supercharges the fundraise.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Sourcing</strong>&nbsp;— Instead of paying overheads and expenses for a centralized investment team to scour for deals, members of the DAO could originate, diligence, and vote on potential investments.<br><br>At first glance, this may sound like a recipe for disaster.<br><br>But I suspect a DAO would uncover more projects — especially in underserved markets (whether by demography, geography, scale, or vertical) — than traditional funds. And the elimination of fee drag would make more of those deals viable.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Alignment</strong>&nbsp;— The tokenization of securities enables participants and stakeholders in a deal to attain tighter alignment. It can alleviate the principal-agent problem, spread ownership within the investee company, and even facilitate the participation of external stakeholders.<br><br>Tokenization also could enhance alignment on value creation, particularly on revenue generation.<br><br>In addition, token holders could receive a variety of pecuniary (i.e., airdropped dividend payments) and non-pecuniary benefits (e.g., exclusive content, limited release products, etc.).<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<ul class="has-link-color"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>&nbsp;— Blockchains provide greater transparency and auditability than user-generated Excel spreadsheets. Cash flows are visible on-chain in near-real time.<br><br>For instance, you can see the entire history of ConstitutionDAO’s contributions&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xd569d3cce55b71a8a3f3c418c329a66e5f714431" target="_blank">here</a>, and can click through to each wallet’s transaction history.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Exits</strong>&nbsp;— Investors don’t have to wait for a liquidity event. A DAO’s tokens could be liquid on day one, and investors could swap their holdings on a decentralized exchange for any number of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>* * *</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, of course there are numerous issues raised in the bullets above, and loads more that weren’t even alluded to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developing an ethical, effective, compliant, and secure protocol is hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, even though I was excited to participate in the ConstitutionDAO experiment — and am amazed at what the team accomplished in so brief a period — I had a few hesitations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One was participants’ reading comprehension: people seemed to think they were going to own a fraction of the Constitution (i.e., a security token) when the homepage of the DAO clearly stated otherwise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another pertained to governance. In return for contributions to the DAO, participants received $PEOPLE governance tokens that granted the right to vote on proposals, etc. These were allocated on a pro rata basis (i.e., a donation of 1 ETH granted you 1 million $PEOPLE). So, the biggest contributors had more votes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not great … but also … as the Constitution recognized … direct democracy isn’t great either. I don’t have a firm view on an optimal solution, but I’m allergic to concentrated power in any form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Yet another was the “<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#what-is-gas" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">gas</a>” — the fees incurred to transact on the Ethereum blockchain. They’re too high, and they’re making ETH unusable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Jumping from the specific case to the general, there’s a gigantic airgap where cyberspace / web3 interfaces with meatspace / reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s one thing to get a DAO together to crowdfund a collectible or invest in a handful of hackers coding something in Solidity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But creating a community that has the vision and stamina to build impactful businesses and real assets in underserved markets is a challenge of a different order of magnitude.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">I’ve spoken with a few people about the nexus of crypto and private markets over the last year or so — even floated the concept of a venture DAO with one or two — but I’d been downright lackadaisical when it came to putting my thoughts down in writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought there was a lot of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But ConstitutionDAO demonstrates that things are moving&nbsp;<em>fast</em>&nbsp;in web3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">And ConstitutionDAO isn’t the only story.

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">I’m hoping that it will enable me to develop a business model / protocol for entrepreneurial finance in web3, and meet people who are building in the space.</p>
