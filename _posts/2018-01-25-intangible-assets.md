<p class="has-link-color">I've been digging through some historical tax receipts data (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_GFzFqyaRc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#NerdAlert</a>) to determine whether investment income — defined as net income from taxable interest, dividends, capital gains, and rent — has been rising as a share of gross income.&nbsp;To my surprise, it has been fairly flat at around 10% in recent years (see Exhibit 1).</p>

<p>Given the run-up in asset prices over the last two years, maybe this picture will change along the lines of the tech bubble and the lead-up to the global financial crisis. We'll have to see once the 2016-17 data are released.</p>

<p>In any event, one of the more interesting facts that I stumbled upon is the growth in royalty income, particularly as a share of rent + royalties. (This is a bundle that the IRS uses). Net income from royalties grew from $5 billion in 1995 to $22 billion in 2011 (the last year for which complete data are available; see Exhibit 2).</p>

<p class="has-link-color">This finding is in line with the conclusions of Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake's&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capitalism without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy</a></span>. It's a thought-provoking book with helpful frameworks for understanding intangible assets.</p>

<p class="has-link-color">I finished the book excited about creating some new entrepreneurial ventures. If you're looking for a synopsis, Martin Wolf has a good piece <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a01e7262-d35a-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
