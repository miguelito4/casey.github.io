<p>I set myself two book-related goals this year: first, I established a target of reading 50 (non-children’s) books. I missed it by some distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, I pronounced a moratorium on book purchases. This went quite well until October, when I purchased two books for a church class (a violation of the letter — but not the spirit — of the law), and a subsequent visit to the library around Thanksgiving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="has-link-color">The library was selling books to raise funds, and — whilst perusing the stacks — I spied a hardcover copy of Sir Kenneth Clark’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Civilisation-personal-view-Kenneth-Clark/dp/B00005VM00/">Civilisation</a> on offer for the paltry sum of $2. This, my friends, is the greatest bargain that has ever been offered. Seriously. How could I turn it down?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Also, as Lao Tzu said, “A tree that is unbending is easily broken.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Moreover, I reasoned to myself, what shall I do with my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Civilisation-Complete-BBC-DVD-Box/dp/B00077284C/">DVDs of the BBC series</a> when DVD players go the way of the dodo? How will I enjoy the art and wisdom? How will I pass <a href="https://youtu.be/w6qYjisp51M?t=447">Sir Clark’s lessons</a> on to my sons? Is it not possible that all of Western Civilization may hinge on this one decision?!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it’s all been downhill after that, with the Amazon boxes arriving like waves of Persians pressing against the gates at Thermopylae.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In any event, the following books are my four favorite reads from this year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Carreyrou’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">Bad Blood</span> was the best book I read in 2018. It exceeds the hype. Carreyrou writes a ripping yarn, and the scope and the scale of the fraud that was Theranos is absolutely astonishing. Jaw-dropping revelations appear on nearly every page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book is replete with delusional people — including an array of credulous board members culled from the upper echelons of the U.S. national security establishment — and is chock-a-block full of shameless mendacity, contemptible management, wanton disregard for patient safety, and atrocious failures of governance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The Handmaid’s Tale | Margaret Atwood</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s strange to remember how we used to think, as if everything were available to us, as if there were no contingencies, no boundaries; as if we were free to shape and reshape forever the ever-expanding perimeters of our lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Margaret Atwood’s dystopian vision of a totalitarian theocracy-of-sorts is chilling. I had a genuine feeling of terror for the protagonist, Offred. I challenge any reader to come away from the book without an appreciation for the importance of reproductive rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">I mean, we live in a time when the President of the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html">has boasted</a>, “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ‘em by the pussy. You can do anything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The craziest thing about the book is how it all seems plausible. Indeed, in some corners of the world — including some pockets here in the States — Atwood’s appalling setting is deemed utopian.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">From the first days following September 11, America’s principal goal in Afghanistan was to destroy Al Qaeda. After more than a decade of effort, Al Qaeda remained active, lethal, and adaptive … The fallout from the Afghan war also persuaded Pakistan’s leaders, after 2011, to give up on any strategic partnership with Washington and to deepen ties to Beijing.</p>

<p class="has-link-color">Steve Coll’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Directorate-C-I-Americas-Afghanistan-Pakistan/dp/1594204586/">Directorate S</a> continues the story of the United States’s “secret wars” in Afghanistan and Pakistan where <span style="text-decoration:underline">Ghost Wars</span> left off, bringing readers forward from September 11<sup>th</sup> to the waning days of the Obama administration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="has-link-color">Directorate S refers to the units within Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) that work covertly with the Taliban, Islamic extremist groups in Kashmir, etc., and which have proven to be as irksome a foe as those found northwest of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line">Durand Line</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coll’s research is meticulous and the narrative has pace. Candidly the book’s level of detail is probably overkill for most people. But, I once worked on these issues and knew some of the characters, so I found it to be quite enjoyable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, when I ponder career decisions I’ve made, I wonder whether I should have carried on in the world of national security / diplomacy / whatever in the Middle East and South Asia.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Would I have made a difference?” I ask myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainly, I could have made an impact at the tactical level. But at the strategic level? Would any of it have mattered?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coll’s book offers a resounding answer: lol, absolutely not.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Christianity, Diplomacy and War | Herbert Butterfield</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We seek too great a sovereignty over our history; and it is wiser to imagine ourselves as rather preparing the ground where many of the most important things in life will grow of themselves. We underestimate the importance of peace and stability in this respect — the importance of peace as the necessary condition for the development of human reasonableness and for the proper balancing of the activities of men.</p>

<p class="has-link-color"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Butterfield">Herbert Butterfield</a>, whom I discovered in a footnote in Toynbee’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">A Study of History</span>, has <a href="https://mikecasey.blog/2014/01/19/the-reckoning/">appeared</a> <a href="https://mikecasey.blog/2015/01/26/life-to-come/">several</a> <a href="https://mikecasey.blog/2015/12/05/favorite-books-of-2015/">times</a> <a href="https://mikecasey.blog/2017/11/24/the-discontinuities-between-the-generations-in-history/">on</a> this blog.

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Christianity, Diplomacy and War</span> [1953] is yet one more deeply edifying lecture series, with this one’s aim centering on how the beliefs and forces of Christianity may be used to solve problems — be they at the level of human nature, the nation-state, or the international system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the book’s also quite a bit more: a discourse on the value of history and the utility of trust, a lesson on the universality of human sin and culpability, a plea for limiting (and limited) war, and an exhortation to avoid ideology and self-righteousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It is a welcome reminder that the individual human being is the appropriate unit of analysis.</p>
