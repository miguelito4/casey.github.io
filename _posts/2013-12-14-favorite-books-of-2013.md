<p>In light of the holiday season and year end, I thought I'd share the best books I read this year. &nbsp;While most of these weren't published in 2013—a number of them dutifully collected dust on bookshelves in no less than three apartments until they were summoned—the following eight books stand out as my favorites over the past 12 months.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America | George Packer</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one can say when the unwinding began—when the coil that held Americans together in it its secure and sometimes stifling grip first gave way. &nbsp;Like any great change, the unwinding began at countless times, in countless ways—and at some moment the country, always the same country, crossed a&nbsp;line of history and became irretrievably different.<sup>1</sup></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shortly after moving to Atlanta, I stumbled across an advertisement announcing a George Packer book launch at the Carter Center. <em>George Packer wrote a new book?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">In a previous life, when I spent my working hours on police capacity-building and interior ministry reform in Iraq—among other things—I found George Packer's writings on the war to be singularly insightful.  <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/theassassinsgate/GeorgePacker">The Assassins' Gate</a> remains the best book I've read on Iraq; and his article <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/10/060410fa_fact2?currentPage=all">The Lesson of Tal Afar</a></em>—chronicling the efforts of then-Colonel H. R. McMaster to implement counterinsurgency doctrine in one city—was one of the most important elucidations of the necessity for a shift in U.S. strategy in Iraq.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was with much interest, then, that I took my seat in the auditorium to listen to Packer discuss an issue I've found myself reflecting upon with greater frequency: the discernible breakdown both in American institutions and the social compact. &nbsp;Adjusting his focus from the realm of foreign policy to the quotidian travails of ordinary Americans, Packer masterfully captures the overwhelming sense of entropy besetting American households.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would have to rank <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Unwinding</span> as the best book of 2013. &nbsp;The stories within its pages make manifest how unsustainable our current economic and political trajectories are, and they emit a whiff of Steinbeck's <span style="text-decoration:underline">Grapes of Wrath</span>.&nbsp; It's hard to avoid the conclusion that we're heading toward A Reckoning—a subject I hope to flesh out at some point—but, like Packer, I'm optimistic that it will bring renewal.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reflections on the Revolutions in France | Edmund Burke</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one of the first and most leading principles on which the commonwealth and the laws are consecrated, is lest the temporary possessors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received from their ancestors, or of what is due to their posterity, should act as if they were the entire masters; that they should not think it amongst their rights to cut off the entail, or commit waste on the inheritance, by destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric of their society; hazarding to leave to those who come after them, a ruin instead of an habitation—and teaching these successors as little to respect their contrivances as they had themselves respected the institutions of their forefathers...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Society is indeed a contract...As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.<sup>2</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the fraying social compact within the United States and The Reckoning to which we're seemingly heading, I thought I'd seek the answers to two questions: what is the right way to view a <em>social compact</em>, and how does a society best navigate change? &nbsp;Edmund Burke's book fit the bill nicely, arguing for<span style="line-height:1.5em">&nbsp;the necessity of conservatism amidst change, and the importance of maintaining linkages across generations.<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="has-link-color"><span style="line-height:1.5em">As politics—increasingly, it seems—becomes a discussion of who pays for what, the intergenerational component should draw greater attention; even though the unborn don't vote. &nbsp;And perhaps it will: legendary investor&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Druckenmiller">Stanley Druckenmiller</a> of Duquesne and Soros fame has been on a road show preaching the gospel of generational equity. &nbsp;While the cynics may argue he's talking his own book, it's worth listening to what he's saying.<sup>4</sup></span></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Great Rebalancing | Michael Pettis</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a world of weak demand growth, demand is the most valuable economic asset.<sup>6</sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Global trade and capital imbalances contributed to the Global Financial Crisis. &nbsp;Five years on, trade and capital imbalances persist, putting us all at risk of another financial crisis or—gulp—worsening trade tensions. &nbsp;Going beyond the blame game (<em>China needs to consume more stuff! &nbsp;Americans are so greedy, they consume too much! &nbsp;Germany must be to blame for something!</em>), Pettis provides an incisive framework for analyzing the global economy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it opens with a discourse on accounting identities and balance of payments arithmetic, and though it can be dry at times, Pettis provides one of the most accessible explanations of the economic sinews linking countries to one another. &nbsp;His chapters on China, Europe and "When Will the Global Crisis End?" are particularly strong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We're all in this rebalancing together, and we risk descending into a beggar-they-neighbor world. &nbsp;As countries pursue the elusive quest for demand, we're already seeing increased restrictions on FDI and reductions in global capital flows (see exhibits below). &nbsp;Pettis's book helps us understand why these are happening, and what these mean.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's all a bit hazy, but I believe my first introduction to James Salter came during the inaugural get-together of a Scotch whisky <del>drinking</del> appreciation society on a damp night in Bologna, Italy a number of years ago. &nbsp;It was one of those nights that ends with a nervous walk home through the medieval city's charming porticoes at that dark hour shortly before sunrise. &nbsp;But I distinctly recall borrowing&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">The Hunters</span> from a friend, and his act of generosity prompted an appreciation for Salter (those sentences!) that continues to this day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it was fitting to read Salter's most recent book about a man coming of age in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century&nbsp;during a trip back to Bologna—which makes two cameo appearances in the book—to reunite with friends. &nbsp;A fitting companion for a trip to Italy, or any train travel.</p>
