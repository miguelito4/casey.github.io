<p class="has-link-color">In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBNppDoD8OY">opening scene to Zero Dark Thirty</a>, the quote listed above fades, and recordings of actual 911 calls from September 11th play to a black screen. It’s unsettling—some might say unethical—and it sets the stage to say: this is how history went down.</p>

<p class="has-link-color">When I saw the movie a few years ago, I left the theater uneasy about the blending of fact with fiction in what would ostensibly&nbsp;come to be viewed as the “true story” about the hunt for Bin Laden.&nbsp; Of course, as we know, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/secrets-politics-and-torture/watch-how-the-cia-helped-make-zero-dark-thirty/">it’s not how it went down</a>.</p>

<p class="has-link-color">But that opening scene encapsulates a feature that seems to be appearing with more frequency—at least in the handful of shows and movies I’ve watched recently: verisimilitude.</p>

<p>Now this verisimilitude is distinct from special effects, jargon, or other means to replicate reality in a fictional setting, as one would see in Saving Private Ryan. &nbsp;It’s also distinct from “truthiness,” which is something that may be&nbsp;plausible or feel true, though ultimately is false.&nbsp; This verisimilitude is the injection of reality into fiction, with the aim of making a fictional product appear true.</p>

<p>Beyond Zero Dark Thirty, you see this with a number of TV news anchors, such as Wolf Blitzer, Chris Matthews and whoever those MSNBC people are, providing <del>news</del> plot updates and color commentary in political dramas such The Ides of March and House of Cards (as well as in more innocuous offerings like The Brink and Skyfall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then you also see this with political appointees, politicians and powerbrokers (read: Valerie Jarrett, Chuck Schumer and Donna Brazile) making cameo appearances on television shows (read: The Good Wife).&nbsp; It’s all a bit bizarre. &nbsp;Maybe they don't have more pressing matters to&nbsp;tend? &nbsp;Though with celebrities gaining currency as politicians, maybe it’s no surprise that politicos would want to moonlight as celebrities?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe all this ain’t really a thing.&nbsp; But with the broader adoption of branded content and native advertising—and not just by companies—I imagine it's&nbsp;going to get harder to suss out fact from fiction; to determine where reality ends and storytime begins.</p>
