**Taking Back Control? States and State Systems After Globalism by Wolfgang Streeck**
This was the most thought-provoking book I read in 2024.  It is a Rosetta Stone for understanding today’s world and the contests that lie ahead. Though a bit academic and turgid in places, it is a masterful exposition of the tensions among capitalism, democracy, and globalization. 

Over the last 50 years, power has been transferred from governments to the private sector, beyond the reach of democratic accountability. The U.S. Constitution was ingenious in its balancing of private interests and state power. But it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the United States is post-Constitutional. 

Like Streeck, I think that a revivification of democracy within states requires stronger restraints on capital and a greater decentralization of political power, and that the next international system needs to accommodate greater diversity and differentiation in political and economic systems than the United States has been willing to entertain.

For more on my thinking over the years:

**The Twilight Before the Storm by Viktor Shvets**
The world is going over the waterfall. Is calamity avoidable?

—

**Science and Human Values by Jacob Bronowski**
> A true society is sustained by the sense of human dignity.
The biggest winners of the zero-rate world are ushering in a technocracy. Many of these people purport to be ‘first-principles’ thinkers concerned about ‘the future of human civilization.’ It’s all a bit Soviet. The only first principle that matters is believing that each human has dignity.
