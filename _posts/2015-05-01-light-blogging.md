<p style="text-align:justify;">In the space of 10 minutes this morning, while trying to get out the door for our child's first pediatrician appointment:</p>

<ul style="text-align:justify;">
	<li>Baby decided he was hungry again so had to nurse</li>
	<li>Baby blew out his diaper</li>
	<li>Baby peed all over himself whilst being changed</li>
	<li>Dog barfed on floor</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All on a couple hours' sleep. Â Light blogging alert.</p>
