<p>Sometime within the next three months I shall become a father.&nbsp; So begins the last big adventure, a maelstrom of unequal parts agency and cupidity. &nbsp;On the one hand lies the opportunity to help mold a decent human being, showering him<sup>1</sup> with love, and equipping him&nbsp;with the values, traits, tenacity and moral fiber required to live a good, meaningful life.&nbsp; On the other lies the awareness that I am incapable of sheltering him&nbsp;from all of life’s cruelties, tribulations, hopelessness and pain; a realization that parenthood entails a degree of submission to the crude determinism of biology and the randomness of fate.</p>

<p>In any event, I was recently enjoying one of my few remaining moments of quietude when—whilst underlining a passage from Herbert Butterfield’s <span style="text-decoration:underline">Christianity and History</span>—a thought popped into my head: one day, when I have departed this vessel of flesh for the great unknown, the collection of books I pass on to my child<sup>2</sup> will be one of the few tangible manifestations of my memory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suppose this could be construed as a somewhat melancholy meditation, but I found it to be vivifying.&nbsp; Decades from now, I thought, in a world the contours of which no one can foresee, my child may pick up this book.&nbsp; And when he reads a sentence that prompted an underline or an illegible scribble of marginalia, an image may crystallize in his&nbsp;mind of the times I sat in my chair, staring intently at a book with pen in hand, oblivious to the entertainment on television or the sundry trivialities that steal one’s time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even more, I thought, if the child absorbs the content of the passage, and experiences a shared moment of revelation, there will be a connection across time.&nbsp; Dead in body, but resurrected&nbsp;in spirit, I may be remembered not solely as a father or a disciplinarian or a man with&nbsp;answers, but now as a fellow traveler in the quest for wisdom.</p>

<p>Perhaps he will come to know his&nbsp;father in new ways, with a newfound appreciation for his humanity—reassessing his strengths and weaknesses, understanding his failures, and finding solace in his moral triumphs and his sins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps he will come to know his&nbsp;father as a man who departed this world with few certainties save the love he gave, but a man who believed that if one possessed sufficient curiosity and looked hard enough, some certainties could be found.</p>
