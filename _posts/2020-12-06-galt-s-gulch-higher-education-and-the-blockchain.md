<p>In Ayn Rand’s&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline">Atlas Shrugged</span>&nbsp;(cue snark), the builders and independent thinkers escape to Galt’s Gulch whilst a constellation of communists and conformists grind society to a halt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a minute since I read the book, but over the last couple of years the notion of Galt’s Gulch has popped up in my conversations with friends — particularly when discussing higher education for our children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of my friends are operating under the assumption that a conventional university education is the path for their children to attain “success.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t think that will be the case in ~15 years, when my — and most of my friends’ — children will reach college age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In part, this is a function of the deterioration in the quality of supply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p class="has-link-color">For instance, Gallup research reveals that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/248222/gallup-bates-purposeful-work-2019.aspx#ite-248231">less than 50%</a>&nbsp;of college graduates succeed in finding purposeful work, while the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/272228/half-consider-college-education-important.aspx">proportion</a>&nbsp;of Americans who deem college to be “very important” declined from 70% in 2013 to 51% in 2019. If the “product” were better, these figures would be higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Moreover, it’s manifest that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/">the meritocracy trap</a>&nbsp;already consigns many elite university graduates to misery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">It’s also a function of market demands for / of university graduates. There are, of course, the&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/does-higher-education-still-prepare-people-for-jobs">well-trodden discussions</a>&nbsp;about the mismatch between employers’ needs and college graduates’ capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">But if the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2020/09/29/2020_college_free_speech_rankings_reveal_crisis_on_campus_110476.html">reports</a>&nbsp;of a declining commitment to free speech and free inquiry on campuses are to be believed, then I think the innovative companies a decade from now will shun recruiting from them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">They will value capabilities, curiosity, and critical thinking above class, conformity, and credentials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">Alas, whilst the demand for “<a href="https://mikecasey.blog/2014/08/10/david-bromwich-and-the-vanishing-art-of-independent-thinking/">right-thinking</a>” individuals may be high amongst today’s academic, corporate, and government institutions, the entrepreneurs and investors building the future seem to abhor it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">In recent months, my Instagram feed has been polluted with Ivy League business schools’ advertisements for online courses about fintech. They charge ~$3,500 for a course taught by faculty members who haven’t built fintech companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">In contrast, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — which raised $515 million for its second crypto fund in April — offers an online&nbsp;<a href="https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a>. It’s free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">The more I read about blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized finance, the less relevant a college degree seems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|primary"}}}}} -->
<p class="has-link-color">The internet continues to democratize access to knowledge, information, and data. We’re in the very early stages of migrating toward&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">an entirely new internet</a>&nbsp;— one that is open, decentralized, and contains extraordinary possibilities for the reconfiguration and exchange of value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indeed, it seems that numerous entrepreneurs and investors in this space are receding from today’s prominent platforms to engineer tomorrow’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The competition for work — amongst humans and against robots / AI — could very well get intense. A commitment to lifelong education is paramount.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the credential of a university degree?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have my doubts.</p>
