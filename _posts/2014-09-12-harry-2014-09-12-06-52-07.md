Hi unpassaggio author,

I just found your blog and was wondering if you might be interested in a project I am setting up.

It's a writing platform called TypeReel (.com)  and I think it can simplify the process of sharing work and hopefully increase readership by combining writers of all kinds of genres.

As you'll see if you check it out, it's free to use and I don't use adverts, I just want to start a bit of a community, full of variety and freshness.

I’m looking to keep the community and writing space growing so was wondering if you might have a look around. 

It'd be great if you fancy putting some work on there to see what you think. It’s a very simple process, sign up takes a few seconds then posting an article is just a few clicks.

There's more info on my idea on the sign up page (typereel.com/signup) or the about us page (typereel.com/aboutus) if you'd like to have a look.

I hope you have time to check it out and please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about it.

All the best,
Harry, Founder
